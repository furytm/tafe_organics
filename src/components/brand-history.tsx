          <p>
            Tafe Organics was established by a mom in her desperation to help her son's skin better. With a love for
            enterprise, Ifeoluwa Folawiyo helped enhanced the beauty of her university friends with makeup for birthdays
            and special events. She made friends with cosmetics store owners and recommended skincare products for her
            friends which she sold for a small token.

          <p>
            Fast forward 3 years after college, she came across a newspaper advert in 2011, on training about how to
            make soaps and lotions. Her interest in cosmetics motivated her to attend the training. Though she never got
            the time to practice what she learnt because she had a full time job. Four years later, she had a son who
            suddenly developed skin allergies making his skin often dry itchy and scaly leading to bouts of sleepless
            nights.

            After countless visits to doctors and using different over the counter medications, she had little success
            with healing her son's skin. Ifeoluwa's mom, concerned about her grandson gifted her African black soap,
            Shea-butter and black palm kernel oil from Ekiti state, Nigeria. Her son's skin greatly improved and she
            remembered she could make more with these gifts as raw materials for making other skincare products.
          </p>

          <p>
            On this journey, she realized that there are many people like her son, both young and old who have sensitive
            and allergy prone skin and that she could help them find a solution while making a business out of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ifeoluwa's desire to reach more people like her son birthed Tafe Organics, an eco conscious beauty brand for
            dry and sensitive skin. Tafe Organics rock ltd was established in August 2021.
